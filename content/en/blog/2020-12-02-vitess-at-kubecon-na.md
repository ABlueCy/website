The Vitess team had a successful presence at Kubecon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020. This year's event was in a virtual format.
We had 2 talks, a project booth and 3 office hours sessions. In addition, we had mentions in 2 major keynote talks.

## Day 1
Day 1 was a non-keynote day. It opened relatively quietly for us. We had 25+ attendees at our office hours session hosted by maintainers Alkin, Deepthi and Derek.
Some people wandered into the project booth.

## Day 2
This was our big day. Not only did we have both Vitess talks on this day, but we also had mentions in keynotes.
First, Priyanka Sharma, CNCF GM spoke about [how HubSpot uses Vitess and Kubernetes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uga3XnFG0to).

Guido Iaquinti and Rafael Chacon of Slack spoke about how they [migrated their MySQL Clusters into Vitess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k51L0xdClGQ).
We wrapped up the day with the [Vitess Maintainer talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqzhgzg5WCw) which featured demos from a number of our maintainers.

Our project office hours featuring Sugu and Rafael drew 120 attendees.

## Day 3
Another quiet day. We had our [monthly public meeting](https://zoom.us/rec/share/A8tOSvILYkUx65bizFvkph7_aFNOyWkEr3VxqqJl5XealI7aKSodVVdaJ5I-mArd.ftVtXObha-BCERxo) (Access Passcode: AKi00k&@) on this day, so we did not host office hours.

## Day 4
We hosted our last project office hours hosted by Alkin Tezuysal and featuring Deepthi Sigireddi and Paul Hemberger. 65 people attended the session.

## Project Booth
We had over 350 unique visitors to the project booth. We had maintainers available to answer questions but most visitors chose to view documents and not engage with the maintainers at the booth.
