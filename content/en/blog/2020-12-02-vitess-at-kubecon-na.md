The Vitess team had a successful presence at Kubecon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020. This year's event was in a virtual format.
We had 2 talks, a project booth and 3 office hours sessions. In addition, we had mentions in 2 major keynote talks.

## Day 1
Day 1 was a non-keynote day. It opened relatively quietly for us. We had 25+ attendees at our office hours session hosted by maintainers Alkin, Deepthi and Derek.
Some people wandered into the project booth.

## Day 2
This was our big day. Not only did we have both Vitess talks on this day, but we also had mentions in keynotes.

Our project office hours featuring Sugu and Rafael drew 120 attendees.

## Day 3
Another quiet day. We had our monthly public meeting on this day, so we did not host office hours.

## Day 4
We hosted our last project office hours hosted by Alkin and featuring Deepthi and Paul Hemberger. 65 people attended the session.

## Project Booth
We had over 350 unique visitors to the project booth. We had maintainers available to answer questions but most visitors chose to view documents and not engage with booth staff.
