Vitess is a database solution for deploying, scaling and managing large clusters of MySQL instances. It's architected to run as effectively in a public or private cloud architecture as it does on dedicated hardware. It combines and extends many important MySQL features with the scalability of a NoSQL database. Vitess can help you with the following problems:

    Scaling a MySQL database by allowing you to shard it, while keeping application changes to a minimum.
    Migrating from baremetal to a private or public cloud.
    Deploying and managing a large number of MySQL instances.

Vitess includes compliant JDBC and Go database drivers using a native query protocol. Additionally, it implements the MySQL server protocol which is compatible with virtually any other language.

Vitess has been serving all YouTube database traffic since 2011, and has now been adopted by many enterprises for their production needs.
