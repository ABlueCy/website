The reference documentation for Vitess covers two main areas: the [Vitess API](vitess-api) and the [vtctl](vtctl) tool. There is work underway to organize this section for better readibility, that may include collapsing other sections into the reference guides.

For reference and historical accuracy, this section also contains the outline of design docs that represent the design considerations that went behind some of the features implemented. They may not be necessarily up-to-date.

Also, some of the ideas here may just be experimental proposals, and it's possible that such ideas might have been abandonned or not implemented yet. The design docs include:

* [Vitess Sequences](vitess-sequences.md)
* [MySQL Server Protocol](mysql-server-protocol.md)
* [Vitess and Replication](vitess-replication.md)
* [Update Stream](update-stream.md)
* [Row-Based Replication](row-based-replication.md)
